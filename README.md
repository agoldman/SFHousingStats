# SFHousingStats
Interactive choropleth map showing the percent of owner occupied housing across SF neighborhoods. Built with Mapbox and Leaflet.

Something I quickly hacked together to play with Mapbox and SF city data : )

Check out the resulting interactive map, [here](http://sf-housing-stats.herokuapp.com/).
